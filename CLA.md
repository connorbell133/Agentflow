# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## TL;DR

**You keep your copyright.** This CLA just gives us permission to include your contributions in both our open-source (AGPL) and commercial versions of AgentFlow. Sign once, contribute forever.

**To sign:** Comment `I agree to the CLA` on your pull request. Done in 10 seconds.

## Why We Need This

AgentFlow uses an "Open Core" business model: the core is open-source (AGPL-3.0), but we also offer a commercial/enterprise version with additional features. This CLA allows us to include community contributions in both versions, keeping the project sustainable while staying open-source. You retain all rights to your work—this just gives us permission to use it.

## Questions?

- **What if I work for a company?** Make sure your employer allows you to contribute. Most companies have IP policies that let you contribute to open source in your free time.
- **Can I still use my code elsewhere?** Yes! You retain copyright and can use your code however you want.
- **What if I don't want to sign?** That's okay—you're welcome to fork the project under the AGPL-3.0 license and maintain your own version.
