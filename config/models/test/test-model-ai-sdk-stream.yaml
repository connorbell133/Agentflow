# AI SDK 6 Stream Test Model
# This model configuration is for testing AI SDK 6 endpoints that already return UIMessage streams
# Use this when connecting to another Next.js app or service that uses AI SDK 6

name: "AI SDK Test Model"
description: "Test model for AI SDK 6 stream pass-through"
endpoint: "https://your-ai-sdk-app.vercel.app/api/chat"
method: "POST"

# AI SDK 6: Set endpoint type to ai-sdk-stream for pass-through mode
endpoint_type: "ai-sdk-stream"

# Headers for authentication (if needed)
headers:
  Content-Type: "application/json"
  # Add your auth header if needed:
  # Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# Body configuration - this is sent to your AI SDK endpoint
# The {{messages}} placeholder will be replaced with the conversation messages
body_config:
  messages: "{{messages}}"
  # You can add other fields your endpoint expects:
  # model: "gpt-4"
  # temperature: 0.7

# No stream_config needed - AI SDK endpoints already return the correct format
# No response_path needed - pass-through mode doesn't convert
# No message_format needed - AI SDK handles message formatting

# Note: This endpoint type expects the response to have the header:
# x-vercel-ai-ui-message-stream: true
# If your endpoint doesn't set this, it won't work in pass-through mode
